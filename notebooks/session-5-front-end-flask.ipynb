    "# Integrating Python Applications with Front-End Technologies Using Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "## Session 5: Quick Touch on Front End\n",
    "\n",
    "This session is designed to give you a fundamental understanding of how Python applications can interact with front-end technologies, particularly focusing on the Flask framework. This is crucial for LCL Logistics where operations often require quick and dynamic interfaces for tracking, management, and reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Front-End Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "In logistics operations, integrating front-end technologies with Python back-ends can facilitate real-time data access and interactive management systems. This can range from tracking shipments in real-time, monitoring storage conditions, to managing transportation schedules efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basics of Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) web application framework. It's designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It offers suggestions, but doesn't enforce any dependencies or project layout. This flexibility makes it an excellent choice for projects at LCL Logistics, where customized solutions are often required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Setting Up Your Flask Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install Flask\n",
    "Before you begin, you need to install Flask. This can be done using pip, Python's package installer.\n"

    "## Extended Session: Using HTML Templates in Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhancing your Flask application with HTML templates can greatly improve its appearance and user-friendliness. This part of the tutorial will guide you through using Flask's template engine, Jinja2, to create and render HTML templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Setting Up HTML Templates with Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask uses a powerful template engine called Jinja2 which allows for dynamic content generation. This is particularly useful for creating complex, data-driven sites like those needed for LCL Logistics operations management.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating the Templates Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to create a directory where Flask will look for your templates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In your project directory, create a folder named `templates`.\n",
    "2. Inside this folder, you will create your HTML template files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example HTML Template\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a basic HTML template to display truck information. Create a file called `trucks.html` inside the `templates` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html lang=\"en\">\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n",
    "    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n",
    "    <title>Truck Information</title>\n",
    "    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='styles.css') }}\">\n",

    "            <p>License Plate: {{ truck.license_plate }}</p>\n",
    "            <p>Model: {{ truck.model }}</p>\n",
    "            <p>Capacity: {{ truck.capacity }}</p>\n",

    "    {% endfor %}\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Serving Static Files\n",
    "\n",
    "To make your application look better, you may want to serve static files such as CSS. Flask handles static files (like stylesheets and JavaScript files) in a directory named `static` in your project root.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a folder named `static` in your project directory.\n",
    "2. Inside this folder, create a file named `styles.css`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example CSS file to style the truck information:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "body {\n",
    "    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    ".truck {\n",
    "    margin: 20px;\n",
    "    padding: 20px;\n",
    "    border: 1px solid #ccc;\n",
    "    border-radius: 5px;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Rendering the Template\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify your Flask route to render the `trucks.html` template instead of just returning a string. Update the `/trucks` route in your Flask application:\n",
